// Nowadays, time complexity of our code can be considered as Big-O.
// Big-O is important for analyzing and comparing the efficiencies of algorithms.
// The analysis of Big-O starts by looking at the code and applying the rules to simplify the Big-O notation.
// The following are the most often used rules:
// 1. Eliminating coefficients/ constants (coefficient rule)
// 2. Adding up Big-O (sum rule)
// 3. Multiplying Big-O (product rule)
// 4. Determining the polynomial of the Big-O notation by looking at loops (polynomial rule)

// BASE RULES
// First sample: (CONSTANT ONLY)
x = x + 1;	// The output of the code depends on x value; then we might considered the time complexity as a constant value. Therefore it must be (O) = 1

// Second sample: (COEFFICIENT RULE)
function action() {
	return x;
}

// Third sample: (SUM RULE)
function acting() {
	return x;
}

// Fourth sample: (PRODUCT RULE)
function actrees() {
	return x;
}

// Fifth sample: ()
function popcorn() {
	return x;
}
